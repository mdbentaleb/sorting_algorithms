#Sorting algorithms & Big O


Sorting algorithms are essential tools for organizing data efficiently,
vital in various computer science applications such as databases and information retrieval.
They vary in efficiency, stability, and adaptability to different data types.
Big O notation quantifies an algorithm's worst-case performance as input size increases,
offering a concise representation of its scalability and efficiency,
crucial for comparing and selecting the most suitable algorithm for specific problems.
